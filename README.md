# Eggs & Bacon
An app for cooking breakfast for a crowd.

## Purpose
<!-- When recently preparing for a big family reunion, I had to organise breakfast for 24 people, and needed to calculate how much bacon we would need. 24 people x3 rashers each is 72. Easy enough. But the Deli Associate at Woolworths would not appreciate having to count out 72 rashers of bacon. -->
Working out how much bacon and eggs to buy and cook for a family of four is easy enough, but what about when you have to cook for ten? Or twenty? Or 100?!?

Don't ask the poor soul at Woolworths to count out 126 rashers of bacon for you! Use Eggs & Bacon to quickly and easily calculate how much to order, reducing stress and waste, and giving you more time to eat brekky.

## Functionality/Features
Enter how many adults and children will be at your banquet, hit the "Fry Up" button and see how much food to buy! Bacon will be in kilograms rounded to the nearest .1, eggs will be rounded to the nearest half dozen for easy purchasing.

Don't worry too much if you have the odd linebacker to feed. When cooking for a crowd, for every Absolute Unitâ„¢ there will be someone who "grabbed Macca's on the way here".

Users will also be able to create an account and log in.
