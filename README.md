# Eggs & Bacon
An app for cooking breakfast for a crowd.

## Purpose
<!-- When recently preparing for a big family reunion, I had to organise breakfast for 24 people, and needed to calculate how much bacon we would need. 24 people x3 rashers each is 72. Easy enough. But the Deli Associate at Woolworths would not appreciate having to count out 72 rashers of bacon. -->
Working out how much bacon and eggs to buy and cook for a family of four is easy enough, but what about when you have to cook for ten? Or twenty? Or 100?!?

Don't ask the poor soul at Woolworths to count out 126 rashers of bacon for you! Use Eggs & Bacon to quickly and easily calculate how much to order, reducing stress and waste.
