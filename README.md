# Eggs & Bacon
An app for cooking breakfast for a crowd.

## Purpose
<!-- When recently preparing for a big family reunion, I had to organise breakfast for 24 people, and needed to calculate how much bacon we would need. 24 people x3 rashers each is 72. Easy enough. But the Deli Associate at Woolworths would not appreciate having to count out 72 rashers of bacon. -->
Working out how much bacon and eggs to buy and cook for a family of four is easy enough, but what about when you have to cook for ten? Or twenty? Or 100?!?

Don't ask the poor soul at Woolworths to count out 126 rashers of bacon for you! Use Eggs & Bacon to quickly and easily calculate how much to order, reducing stress and waste, and giving you more time to eat brekky.

## Functionality/Features
Enter how many adults and children will be at your banquet, hit the "Fry Up" button and see how much food to buy!

Don't worry too much if you have the odd linebacker to feed. When cooking for a crowd, for every Absolute Unitâ„¢ there will be someone who "grabbed Macca's on the way here".

## Target Audience
* Novice cooks: Just moved out of home. Has literally never had to think about this sort of thing before this very moment. Has realised they can't have Two Minute Noodles for *every* meal.
* Home chefs: Experienced in the culinary arts but unaccustomed to cooking for the masses.
* Cafe owners: Fluctuating customer numbers are commonplace. They need a quick answer to the "how much to order?" question for the long weekend, so they can get back to running their business.
